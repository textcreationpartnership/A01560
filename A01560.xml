            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Quite againſt the Rule of Reaſon, the Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent is the receptacle for the Subiect.

And this is the woe of all; that
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:3139:27"/> Men are irrecouerably Euill. Their corruption hath brought them to a cuſtome; their cuſtome to an Obſtinacy; their Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinacie to a Neceſsitie of being Euill: and that Neceſsity of being Euill, to an impoſsibility of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing otherwiſe. As a <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine Philoſopher</hi> to his Friend; When thou ſhalt ſee (ſaid hee) a Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude in a Market, Theatre, or like frequented place; thinke with thy ſelfe, there are as many Vices, as Men.

Men were neuer ſo many, but one man might reckon all the reſt: But the Sins of one man, are more than he can count; much more, than for which he can giue account. What ſay we of men, and their Sins?

            <p>
               <hi>The Manners of Men haue now brought Lawes themſelues into their Subiection. Neuer more Lawes; none more Lawleſſe, than now adaies. What Offences are done daily before the Barre of Iuſtice? Right is but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Defended, euen where Right ſeemes to bee moſt Reſerued. Lawes are bought, and ſold: And he commonly hath the beſt

Lawes are ſo many, and ſo abuſed; that they are made to diſcourſe, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute Truth, and Right: Whereas were they fewer, and well executed; they would eaſily and readily determine, and command them both. Nor doth a Common wealth labour ſo in the multitude of Lawes, as of Lawyers. (I ſpeake not of iuſt Iudges, and equall Officers of the Law.) But of cunning Catchpoles, and hungry Pettifoggers; that (like

Theſe (if you knew all) haue robbed many a Church, wronged many a Widow, ſtarued many an Orphan, and vndone many an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt Man. In foule ſtirres, and Contentions of Men, theſe thruſt in for more filthy Aduocates. Of theſe I ſay; Many Lawyers, many Wranglers. Elſe, how ſhould theſe men liue, that are raiſed by others ruines; did they not make worke for themſelues. Theſe Seminaries of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſention, haue a Cauill, or a
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:3139:34"/> Quirke, to make the Law it ſelfe (which indeed is a Rule of Peace) ſet Men at oddes and keep them ſo. As when you ſend your Water to a needy Empiricke, you muſt reſolue to take Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicke: ſo declare your caſe to one of theſe greedie Catchpoles, and you muſt needs goe to Law. Nay, hee tells you what wrong you haue done your ſelfe hitherto: and all to bring you (by his meanes) to doe your ſelfe, and others Wrong. You (like ſilly ſheepe) take this Bryar-Buſh to ſhelter you; and
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:3139:34"/> hee all to tatters your Fleece: you two muſt tugge together ere you part. His is the Gaine on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the end, yours (per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps) both the Loſſe, and Shame.</hi>

               <hi>This is alſo a ſore euill vnder the Sunne: Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue is ſet after Wealth Wealth gets vp a Cocke-horſe; while Vertue but holds the Stirrop. Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning is made but a Page to Riches. The Golden Aſſe is worſhipped; the Ragged Philoſopher is contemned. Let a man be Religious, Vertuous, Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:3139:35"/> Wiſe; yet this thing is thought to preiudice his beſt Parts; that hee is Poore: But let him bee Impious, Vicious, Clow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh, Fooliſh; yet that he is Rich, makes amends for all the Reſt. A Man without Money, is abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red like a Monſter: but adored as a Goddeſſe, is Money without a Man. This ſame Goddeſſe Wealth, bewitches vs all to her Worſhip. For her wee plot, and pray; and ride, and run; and digge, and begge. For baſe Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cres ſake, wee are ready

            <p>
               <hi>The World turns round in a Topſie-Turuy; and euery Thing goes the wrong way to worke.

Euery Man conſiders what he Aimes at; not what he is Apt for. <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury</hi> is made out of euery Logge. Dunſes goe for Scholars; Wretches are preſt for Souldiers; Idiots vſurpe Authoritie; and Knaues creepe into Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: Taylors take Orders; and Weauers will bee Prieſts. Frogs profeſſe Phyſicke. Wherein is a Mans leaſt Skill; that is his whole Profeſsion. Men
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:3139:36"/> trauell in vntimely Births, labour in vnapt Actions: Like Channels without a Conduit; turne Teachers, when they yet both might, and ought to Learne. They vſually come armed to the Church; goe naked to the Campe: ſing at a Fune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall; mourne at a Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding: ſtudy hard in a Play-houſe; ſit fidling in a Senate-houſe: earneſt in a May-Game; and ſlacke vpon their Seruice. One takes vpon him to ſwim ouer <hi>Helleſpont</hi> on a Horſe; Another aymes to aſcend <hi>Athos</hi> in a Ship:

One takes butterd Peaſe on his Knife point; Another eats Eggs with Spoones. Bid him ſpeake, &amp; he is mute: ſay Whiſht, and he babbles. He writes Politicks, ere he yet come into a Common-wealth; Commands peremptorily, where he hath ſmall Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie; flatly Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines, what he leaſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiues.

All turne Merchant Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenturers, (for Places, Offices, Dignities; Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall, Eccleſiaſticall) and buy long Hopes, with a large Price. How many fondly both aduenture, and vndoe themſelues, to be well ſpoken of? Speake him but faire to his Face, and you may haue his Heart out. His Table fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhes him with Friends; and they likewiſe his Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: And now the Cloth ſcarce taken vp, but they are ready to riſe. Men are all for the Preſent:
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:3139:38"/> And for that, ſo as it be commodious. What hath formerly beene, is now forgotten. There is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed a quicke Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, but no good Memory of one anothers Acts, and Offices. If he cannot ſo doe, as he hath done; he ſhall not be ſo thought, as he was. Former things are Froſted. An old Dogge ſhall bee hanged; an old Seruing-Man diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carded; and an old Friend neglected: notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding they haue beene for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly ſo Vſefull, Painfull, Beneficiall. A man cannot
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:3139:39"/> tell whom to truſt to; nor how to beleeue him. Beſide what his Heart imagines, and Tongue vtters; his very Face betokens Falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood. Hee'll blow hot, and cold both with a wind: Say, and vnſay, nay gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay with a Breath. Will promiſe Mountaines, and performe Mole-hills: and tell you of more in a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute, than you ſhall finde in a Yeare. Nay (which is worſt) will both Say well, and Doe well in De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit. As, many a man hath had a Good Turne done him: not altogether
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:3139:39"/> to benefit, but to blinde, and bewitch him rather. A Man ſpeakes a good word for his Friend, and two for himſelfe: And commonly ſo aduiſes him, as to bring his owne ends about. Two men contend together, and a Third ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrates to eithers loſſe. Like Dogges, they ſnarle at one another, till the Bone bee ſnatcht away from both Great men eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly take occaſion to wrong Inferiours with authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. And the Poore man hath offended enough; in that hee is not able to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:3139:40"/> himſelfe. The Poore man muſt part with his owne Right; or elſe hee giues not the great Lord his Due. Rich mens Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluities are growne en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uious <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

Like Dogges in Mangers; they haue no need of it, they haue no will to it; and yet they keepe the poore Cattell from their Fodder. If a Man bee once downe the Hill; euery Man is apt to depreſſe him further. Once gored in the Body of his Eſtate, how many Hounds purſue him, and trace him
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:3139:40"/> ſtill by the bloud of his Wound? He is ſoone made more miſerable; that is once ſo. None hath leſſe paid him, than he, to whom moſt is due. Whom his Piety doth moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend; him doth their Charitie leaſt reward. It is both the Rule and Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, to repell Force with Force: and repay Craft with Craft. So are wee wont to doe to others, as we ſee they haue done; not as we would they ſhould doe, to vs. Doe a Man Good; and this is thankes enough, that hee doth thee
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:3139:41"/> no Hurt. How many are ready to reward Euill for Good: and to wrong him moſt, of whom he beſt deſerued? What Spiders Webbes are here in the World? Turbulent Waſpes burſt through; while Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent Gnats are intangled. The Gallowes groanes for great Theeues; and ſmall Theeues only groane vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Gallowes. What one Man doth, is a Fault, and Puniſhed: What ſo many doe, is thought well, though worſe. Tis ſtrange, that the Greatneſſe, and Generality of a Crime;
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:3139:41"/> ſhould make it ſeeme leſſe miſchieuous, leſſe miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, leſſe puniſhable. That belike is Lawfull, which comes once to be Common And (which is laſt, and worſt) Men liue, at Mens luſts: So alſo, Men periſh, at Mens pleaſures. And to Kill; is both Courage, and Skill. Murder is made a Mans Art: and tis his Credit, to haue handſomely done the Deed. Beſides thoſe that are euill to others; how many are ſo vnto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues? How many Giants are there; how many
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:3139:42"/> Gulfes of their Eſtates? They carrie all vpon their Backes; Theſe put all into their Bellies: theſe feed finely, and rot at a deare rate: They goe gayly, till they bee worth not aboue their wearings. He makes a God of his Belly; Hee a Channell of his Throat; He a Sinke of his Heart; He a Lyer of his Tongue; Hee a Theefe of his Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers; He a Harlot of his Members.

<pb n="55" facs="tcp:3139:42"/> Luſts; are all (if ſins) but Veniall Sinnes. No ſinne is ſo great; but is leſſened in his Opinion, by whoſe Miſchiefe it is committed. Goodneſſe and Truth haue not more Precepts, than Aduerſaries thereunto. The Couetous man ſhrinks and ſhrugs, at a Leſſon of Liberality: It irkes a Prodigall, to tell of Thrif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſſe: The Proud man endures not to heare of Humbleneſſe: The Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full hath no Patience, no not ſo much as to liſten thereunto: The Theefe ſtops his eares at the
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:3139:43"/> Charge of Iuſtice: The deſperate Cut-throat is ready to diſpatch him firſt, that would diſſwade him from the Fact: Tis tedious to talke of Chaſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe before the Luſtfull: And Soberneſſe to a Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kard, is but as a Tale of a Tubbe. Theſe men will euery one ſooner marre the Rule, than mend their Fault. Wicked men will rather abhorre the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, than forſake their Offences.

<pb n="78" facs="tcp:3139:54"/> bee wary what hee now doth. Sinne was the only meanes, that brought a Man to Death: but Death is thus the only meanes, to keepe a Man from Sin. He aimd aright; <q rend="inline large">Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the End, <hi>(ſaid he)</hi> and thou ſhalt neuer doe amiſſe.</q> To meditate on Death, is as a Curbe againſt all ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Courſes: and a Spurre pricking on to pious Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties Pricke the wandring Snaile but with the <hi>ME<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MENTO</hi> of Deaths Dart; and hee ſtraight
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:3139:54"/> retires into his Shell: Let the Pilot ſit cloſe in the End of the Ship; and hee now gouernes it aright. To haue Death before his Eyes; is the ready way, to haue God before his Eyes.

Hee ſhewes it, but he heeds it not.</hi> To Day hath chang'd him from Yeſterday, both in Face, and Faſhion: Nor ſhall you ſee him the Same to Morrow, that he is to Day. The Man
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:3139:57"/> ſeemes but as he is; a very Changeling. Nay he ſo adapts his Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour alſo to his Habit; that you ſhall neuer take him, but in as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Minds, as Suits. How he grudges at the ſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Courſe of Nature, as but niggardly; that at firſt allotted him but one Face and Skinne, and Bulke, and Shape: but admires the Liberall Inuention of Art; that can ſtill ſo trimly, and newly proportion him. He thinkes himſelfe (I warrant him) a farre
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:3139:57"/> comelyer Creature of a Taylors ſhaping, than of Gods making. As the one therefore he ſhames to be ſeene: but as the other, hee glories to ſhew himſelfe. He is one of ADAMS owne Sonnes, and hath it by Kinde to bluſh at his bare Selfe. <hi>Ah! we could not thus irke our ſelues, were not our ſelues con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious of ſome thing other than good: Wee ſee ſome vglineſſe, which wee would haue none to ſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Oh but (I ſee) he hath quite altered the Faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and hath made him a new kinde of Catch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credit, of his old Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer-ſhame. His ſightly Ornament, hee counts it; which was once but his Fore-Fathers beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garly Shift. <hi>Ah! that

He is not (I ſee by him) a little proud of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe: now beclad in a varniſht Excrement; &amp; ſo bedawbd in a glitte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Rubbiſh. <hi>Who thinkes himſelfe the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Man, for what he is
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:3139:59"/> glad to borrow of Beaſts, and Earth? Is hee the more Man, for what they (before him) were not the leſſe Bruits, &amp; Dung?</hi> See ſee! A Sheepe in a golden Fleece: Howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer hee thinkes of his Fleece; I will thinke him but a Sheepe. Hee prances moſt ſtatelily in his gay Trappings. But I would be loth to buy, or vſe an Horſe, that is only ſo valued. <hi>It is for him to prize a faire Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide; that knowes, nor hath nothing within, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy more eſteeme.</hi> How
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:3139:59"/> curiouſly hee glances vpon himſelfe? Hee thinkes, hee is for other eyes than his owne, to be ſo broadly gazed at. Why cringes he ſo to his Coat? vnleſſe he would in good earneſt, which the Philoſopher did in ieſt; <hi>Honour that, that honours him. Bucephalus</hi> is now royally trapt, and flings at all but <hi>Alexander</hi> himſelfe: diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barbe but the Iade, and euery Stable-Groome may beſtride him. <hi>Many Men as Proud to ſeeme what they are not: It only

            </p>
            <p>A proper Squire hee ſeemes neere at hand; and (you marke him) well dight vp. Beſide a ſpruce ſhape, and gay Gloſſe hee hath about him; ſee what a lofty
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:3139:60"/> Port, and Geſture hee carries with him. Hee ſtalkes on in ſtate: I ſhould ſay, he marches moſt maieſtickly. All his Pace is Meaſures; and his Hands accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly keepe Time, to the Tune of his Feet. His Beuer cocks, Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther waggs, Locks ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, and Beard ſtands in print: his Band ſprea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding (like a Net) about his necke, his Cloake diſplayd (as a Flagge) vpon his arme, his Dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blet hanging by Gim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers vpon his ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:3139:61"/> and his Breeches button'd about him: His Boots ruffle, Spurrs gingle, and his long Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pier (which he is often tied to) confronts him at the hilt; and toward the point, anſwers his heeles with a grace. What a ſupercilious Looke he hath? I war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant you, the very blaſt or ſound of his Speech, would make you ſtart. How he reares in the Necke, ſtruts at the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke, and traces with his Armes a kemboll: he trips with his Toes
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:3139:61"/> on the Earth, &amp; waues his Hand, as hee would touch the heauens with his Finger. He hath one part and propertie of a Man, which is, to looke vpwards. Hee thinks this ſame doth preferre him with Reaſonables, when we know it doth but diſtinguiſh him from Bruits. Heele ſet his Leggs vpon the Laſt, rather than loſe an inch of his height: I will ſay one good word for him; and tis the beſt I know by him: Than this Man in his way, no man
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:3139:62"/> walkes more vprightly. Marke how he heaues, as though hee almoſt ſcorn'd to tread: Hee caſts vp his Noſe into the Wind, looks beyond the Clouds, mantles againſt the Moone, and buſies himſelfe wholly to build Caſtles in the Aire. What an Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans pace hee comes? Hee prolongs the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geant for the Beholders take; and hurries nor on too haſtily, leſt moſt Eyes finde no leiſure to looke vpon him. See ſee! he ſtops and turnes in
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:3139:62"/> the mid way, at but the apprehenſion of a loſt labour. Oh doe him not the wrong to looke beſide him: for if you ſee him not, hee comes by to no purpoſe. <hi>The Proud man is not more haughty in his owne, than ridiculous in a wiſe mans eyes: whereas others looke at him, hee lookes thorow him; and ſees plainly the vanitie of his Minde, in that bodily ſhaping: Hee but ſmiles at that Carriage of his, which others learne: And thinkes, what Folly there
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:3139:63"/> is in Pride, that faines to it ſelfe, as it would; and flatters it ſelfe, as it hath fained. Hee tels her, his eyes are purer, than her painted glory can dazle: nor are they ſtinted to behold that only, which ſhee would haue him ſee. Hee cals her the Ape of Nations, and Faſhion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monger of the World: and tels her plainly, ſhee hath more Followers of her Faſhions, than are either Wiſe, or Good.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Doe you heare Sir? Surely his eares are ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken vp to liſten only to
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:3139:63"/> his owne fantaſticke Suggeſtions. Hee is wholly buſied about himſelfe: and heeds not others, while he thinkes others cannot chooſe but heed him. At him once more: I pray you Sir—Now he ſquints at mee ouer the left ſhoulder, as though he deemd mee at a glance, ſcarce worth the moſt careleſſe peece of his no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice. Perhaps hee likes not the faſhion of my phraſe, tis too homely for his quaint relliſh, and ſounds not corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondent
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:3139:64"/> to the ſcra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of his whole ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance. I am not wonted to the fine Flouriſhes of his Faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onall Rhetoricke. Hee would haue heard mee ſooner, had I beſpoke him in his owne Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect; which hee heeds moſt, and beſt vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands. I had forgot to thinke on ſome curious Complement, and refi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Salute: which him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe hath ſo often cond, that he hath them at his Tongues end, and there only. Now I remember
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:3139:64"/> me, I haue a whole Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of them lying by me; which he gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red but by Fragments, and ſo he vtters them. Saue you noble Sir; How fares your Body? You are fortunately met; I congratulate your happy Fortunes; Sir I honour you; Would I might doe you any Office; I thinke me happy in your Noble Society; I deſire your more Acquaintance; I embrace your loue with both armes; I kiſſe your hands; I a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore

Oh Sir your Seruant; Pray Sir command mee; That I were but worthy to obſerue you, Would I might haue enioyed your good company; Happineſſe attend you; my Seruice wait vpon you. <hi>Vaine Verbaliſts! whoſe words are but wind, vttered, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in themſelues: Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly occaſioned, and as lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:3139:65"/> intended. God gaue you your Tongues, to vſe them ſeriouſly, not to dal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with ſo deceitfully. Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath taught you the faculty of Speech, to tell euch others your minds, and hearts: But you haue coyn'd, and con'd your words of Art, to diſcourſe, and diſſemble with. Your words of Courſe, and Complement; gaine you as little Heed, and Repoſe from others: as they haue Truth, or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention in your ſelues. You thinke you haue learnt to ſpeake with a
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:3139:66"/> grace; and talke in a certaine royalty of Speech: When (alas) it is the Vanity onely that is openly heard, and ſecretly ſmiled at.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I am your poore Friend Sir, doe you know mee? Not? Hee hath but ſaid, as I thought. <hi>A proud Man remembers not another; becauſe he hath forgotten himſelfe.</hi> Yet (if I mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake him not) hee ſo loues himſelfe, whom he knowes not; that he almoſt hates all others, whom he knowes. He
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:3139:66"/> enuies his Superiour, neglects his Equalls, deſpiſes his Inferiour. And for theſe laſt, hee neither endures to take notice of them; nor that they ſhould make acquaintance with him Hee hath heard, <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliaritie brings Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt:</hi> he therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temnes all kinde of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarity. So does hee glory in what hee is; that than of what hee was, hee is of nothing more aſhamed. Hee thinks himſelfe a good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Branch, and noble;
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:3139:67"/> but irkes to thinke on the vile and baſe Stocke he grew vpon. Nothing can more diſgrace him, than if his poore Father ſhould meet him, and owne him in the Streets: And he bluſhes ſooner at the meaneneſſe of his Kinsfolks, than at their Miſdemeanours. <hi>Who ſo Proud as hee, than whom none more baſe? The Begger on horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>backe, is altogether for the lofty pace. Wretches alwayes wax moſt inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, Cowards rigorous, and Peaſants haughty.
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:3139:67"/> If he get once to thinke better of himſelfe, hee therefore thinkes worſe of all: He concerts others vnder him; becauſe hee is now rapt aboue him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Tis true I tell you. You know not mee whom you ſcome; you I both know, and pity Your Name (I take it) is <hi>Sir Haughty-Heart,</hi> A man of an High De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent: Your Great Grand Father (I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member) came tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling downe from Heauen. <hi>He</hi> (let me ſay
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:3139:68"/> by the way) <hi>fell iuſtly, that was too Proud, to ſtand vprightly.</hi> And you his Generation, like Monſters, you fling Mountains vpon heaps; Yea like Fooles in a Confuſion, you build you <hi>Babels</hi> ſo high; as though you would reach, and dare Him; againſt whom your firſt Father once aſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. I eaſily obſerue, <hi>The Proud Man and the Deuill conſpire in one preſumptuous Fault: it therefore is, hee ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards with him the like

            </p>
            <p>Nay ſcowle not, ſtare not, ſtampe not, ſweare not; keep in your threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Words, &amp; Weapon. <hi>Galled Conſciences kicke (like Iades) when their Sores are touched:</hi> Giue me leaue a little.

Nor is it a ſingle Duell I ſummon and prouoke thee to; but a ſet Battell. I can

But, Humility giues me the ſafer Ground, Grauity rancks my Troopes, Modeſty beats vp my Drumme, Meekneſſe receiues the Onſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

Your feather-flanting Braua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>does are at length but a blaſt before our Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-beaten Souldiers: and who now ſounds Retrait? Pride is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horſt by Humility, Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uity hath giuen Raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe the foyle, Modeſty hath ſtopt the mouth of Vain-glory, Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe hath coold the courage of Diſdaine, Inſolence is pinioned by Patience, and Selfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceit hath taken heels and is runne away from
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:3139:70"/> thee. Thy Souldiers are thus put to ſword, and flight: and loe (as I ſaid) ſafety, and glory on both ſides! Of a baſe Commander thou art now become an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Captiue: Nor are we otherwiſe proud of the conqueſt; than that thou art hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bled in the Foyle.

To embrace an happy, and laſting league, is needfull for thee, and for vs expedient: ſith thou haſt the Benefit, and we the Credit of the victory. Only thou ſhalt confeſſe, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce; the Warre was moſt iuſtly begunne, and as happily ended. <hi>Happy is hee, whom Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iue hauing conquered, hath made her Captiue,

            <p>How anſwereſt thou my Challenge? Enter Liſts accordingly, and thou ſhalt finde I haue propheſied the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, order, and euent of a Myſticall Pfeucho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machie. What needs all this (thou ſaift) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt vs? Thou haſt euer profeſt thee a

In plaine tearmes (ſo eaſily thou canſt excuſe it) Thou ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer knew'ſt what Pride was; nor yet canſt thou tell how to be Proud. No Man hath beene ſo vicious, but that he hath made Vertue his profeſſion. Euen the moſt diſſolute will not owne their Vices: but will yet vſurpe a name from the former, howeuer the latter bee their practice.
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:3139:72"/> 
               <hi>Neuer man was ſo proud, as to thinke himſelfe ſo: That Pride were more abbominable than was Lucifers, that could be proud of it ſelfe.</hi> But liſten, and Ile teach thee how to know thy ſelfe: Giue eare awhile to thy ſelfe; I'le deſcribe thee a Man ſo like thee in all points and proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: as that hee that ſees you together, muſt put on his Spectacles, and view all things double, that takes you for two.</p>
            <p>A <hi>Proud Man</hi> is one
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:3139:72"/> that climbes the wrong way to aſcend thither; from whence his Father fell. Is his owne NAR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CISSVS, and all Mens TIMON: hating o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and enamoured of himſelfe. One that eſteemes himſelfe in a Contempt of others: or contemnes others in his owne Eſteeme; you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſay whether firſt, or more. Many a thing doth hee contemne in another, and yet ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites it in himſelfe. He wonders at what hee hath, &amp; boaſts of more.
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:3139:73"/> He reckons his Chic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens before they bee hatcht; and all his Geeſe are Swans. He growes as bigge as a Mountaine, though he bring forth, but a Mouſe: and as ſoone as he hath laid, he Cac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kles. He boaſts of thoſe parts of his; wherein many Beaſts excell him, and ſay nothing. The little he hath ſo dazles him, that he ſees not what a deale he wants. His vices he puts in the backe part, but his Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues in the fore part of
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:3139:73"/> the Wallet. Them he ſoone forgets, theſe hee oft repeats. Swan-like, he carries a ſtiffe necke ouer his white Feathers, but ſees not that his feet are blacke. Others Faults, and his owne Parts are ſtill before him: and thus while he compares, he cannot but preferre himſelfe. Becauſe he is ſomewhat better than the worſt; he thinkes him now as good as the beſt. Hee hath ſo many Inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours, that he thinkes no man his Superiour.
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:3139:74"/> Whereas others are to others; this Man is an Hypocrite to himſelfe: For he ſeemes to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, what hee is not; and if he be any thing ſo, yet he thinkes him more than he is. He pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes ſuch things to himſelfe, which nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are, nor are like to bee: and buſies, yea pleaſes himſelfe (for the while) in his fained Conceit, as in the reall Fruition. Touching himſelfe, he ſubiects, his Opinions to no Mans: and in anothers
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:3139:74"/> Cenſure, he yeelds to none before himſelfe. His Matter, or anothers; he examines it in the ballance of his owne Iudgement; and is as impatient to remit it, as to haue it contradicted. He takes Chalke, and a Coale in hand: and his White, or Blacke muſt ſtand. The Good Deeds he doth (as the Wrongs that are done him) he ſtill remembers He caſts to meet the benefited Party in the Street, or a Throng; and there lookes for ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement:
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:3139:75"/> And if it be ſo old, or were ſo ſlender, that he hath now forgot it; he yet takes occaſion by the by, to put him in mind of it. He ſmiles to heare his owne praiſe in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers mouth; and yet ſo minces thereat, as though he would ſeem to bluſh: But at length is content to yeeld to others Sooth-ſayings, before the Teſtimony of his owne Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: and caſily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwades him to bee as they ſay; though they
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:3139:75"/> ſay nothing ſo as he is. <hi>All Men are Lyers; and the Proud man moſt of all:</hi> for (at once) hee tranſgreſſes the bounds of Modeſty, and Truth: For while his owne Suggeſtion makes him talke ſo largely; your owne Suſpicion cannot thinke he ſayes truly. Theres not an ill man hates his Fellow, this Man only excepted. A Drunkard accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies a Drunkard; a Whoremonger embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces a Whoremonger; a Theefe ſhakes hands

Not a Motion of his, not a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, which ſmels not of Affectation. Nor ſo much but he Sirs, and

He talkes all with Interrogations; as though his words were of Authority to queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on euery thing. That you enter his Thre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhold, is more than a common courteſie; but that you approach his Preſence, is a great vouchſafement. What
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:3139:77"/> ſhall I call him? A THRASO, a POLY<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PHEMVS? To whom ſhall I liken him? To MAXIMINVS, that made his Senatours kiſſe his feet? to DO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MITIAN, that would be ſtiled a God? or to thoſe diuers POPES, that were guilty of both? or to LVCIFER, the Father of them all? To what ſhall I compare him? But to a Cocke, that claps, and crowes vpon his owne Dung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hill; a Peacocke that ruffles in his owne Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers;
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:3139:78"/> a Toad that ſwels with his owne poiſon; an Aſſe that hath gotten on a Lions skinne, and now he is a Companion for none, but ſuch as he ſeemes; an Ape that is enamou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of his own and vgly Puppets: a Chameleon that gapes after the Aire; a Bladder full of Wind; a ſhallow Riuer, and bubbling; an empty Caske, and ſounding; an addle Egge, and ſwimming; a Thinne Eare, and blaſted, that out-tops the fat and full

            <p>Tuſh! I know thee, and all thy Kinne; and haue been but too much acquainted with all of thine acquaintance.

Thou canſt walke ſo farre and wide on thine owne Ground, that thou thinkſt euery Paſſenger muſt needs treſpaſſe vpon thee: Take but the Map, and ſhew me in what part of the World thy Land lyes.

Meere notionall is their value; which is in the Opinion, not in the Thing: They are worth nothing, only if you can but thinke them ſo. The Merchants Aduenture hath tranſported them,

            <p>Who, <hi>Sir Lofty-lookes</hi> the Courtier? I ſaw him tother day in his golden Fetters: and heard him make great boaſt of (me thought) but a glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Miſerie. Hee hath gotten (he thinkes) to bee more happie than
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:3139:85"/> he was; and hath quite forgotten what he was. Fortune hath exalted him, and how he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alts himſelfe? Cleane contrary to the Rule; the Man thinkes his Place hath graced him: and looks chiefly to be obſerued according to his place. He is growne to be better clad than his Maſter; yea and beares an higher minde. <hi>It is hard to be chaſte in company with a Woman, to bee ſober at a Banquet, to be patient in a Fray: as hard to be humble in
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:3139:86"/> the midſt of new heaped Honours, &amp; Preferments. How rarely doth he ſtoope ſo low; that ſo ſuddenly is rapt ſo high?</hi> Like a Moth, or Rat of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace; hee hath oft and much inquired after this mans Life, that mans Office, the other mans Eſtate: and (after long, and earneſt gaping) ſome, or all theſe are fallen into his mouth. And now hee hath climb'd ſo high on a ſudden, that you would wonder hee wrought not himſelfe out of
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:3139:86"/> breath. To ſay all of ſuch an one, in ſumme: <hi>Many hee ſcornes, his Inferiours; Hee enuies Many, his Fellowes: One he ſoothes, his Lord; One he loues, Himſelfe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But what of <hi>Captaine Scape-skarre?</hi> How hee ſtalkes vp and downe the ſtreets in his Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moyſe, and a Trun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheon; that neuer ware an Harneſſe, nor ſcarce can wield a Sword. O but take heed how you wrong him! Hee hath more Badges of his Art and Valour about him;
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:3139:87"/> then a ſide Belt, or a Buffe Coat. Haue you not heard of his Wounds and Skarres, ſo many haue beene told of? He bids you ſee the Gaſh he gat in his Forehead; and feele the Bullet, that lies in his Calfe: and you muſt now thinke how hee then hazarded; whereas (perhaps) hee gat the one as he look't backe, the other as hee ran away. It is a maruell he tells you not, how he ſtood like a Giant amidſt the Pigmies: how with the blaſt of his firſt
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:3139:87"/> Volley, he made the Enemy quake like leaues; made them flie like Feathers; and ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered them like duſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Wind. And you muſt now beleeue him; or elſe you doe him the diſhonour, as if you ſhould either gainſay, or diſproue him. He tels you what a monſtrous leape he tooke when he was laſt in <hi>Rhodes:</hi> and if you will be pleaſed (for experience ſake) to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the Place where he is, to be <hi>Rhodes;</hi> he will alſo giue you leaue to
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:3139:88"/> ſuppoſe the Leape. <hi>Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers (bee they the moſt valiant and fortunate, that euer lifted hand or foot, for God, and their Country) loſe ſo much of their glory; by how much their owne mouths are the Trumpets of their Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. Modeſty is not leſſe noble in a Warriour, than is valour. If he haue ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the City, let his works praiſe him in the Gate; not his words only, when hee hath now got the Towne vpon his backe. He hath wonne the Field; perhaps with a greater
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:3139:88"/> loſſe: and why boaſts hee of a Prize, when all is too little to make amends? How ſayes he, his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie is vanquiſhed; when his owne are not recoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red? The Day is his; it might haue beene the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaries: and why in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſults he, where he might haue couched? With what Glory can he boaſt, where he might haue complained with ſhame enough?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Ah but theres One of you (beleeue me, I could both loue, and honour him; did he not ſaue me that labour, in
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:3139:89"/> doing the Office to himſelfe) No matter for his Name; You may think he is a noted Man. The Man hath good Parts and Gifts in him; you need not tell him ſo, he knowes it well enough: you ſhould take him for a Beaſt, ſhould you thinke him ignorant of his owne Strength: He can doe well; yea, and he thinks as well of what he can doe. <hi>As it was not ill for <hi>MOSES</hi> that his Face ſhone, and the People ſaw it, though himſelfe
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:3139:89"/> knew it not: So were it well for vs, did our light ſo ſhine before Men, that they might ſee our good workes, and we our ſelues ignorant to boaſt it. The Harpe ſounds no leſſe ſweetly, though it hear not it ſelfe: Our good Parts would bee no leſſe laudable, though our ſelues tooke no notice of them. It is both ſafe and profitable vnto vs, that our ſelues haue beene ignorant of our Gifts. How vſuall is it, to foreſtall our beſt Parts, with a fore Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit? Many men might
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:3139:90"/> in time haue beene both Good, and Wiſe; had they not as yet thought them ſo. This hinders the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of Good Parts, when we thinke we haue attained them ſo ſoone.</hi> God, and Nature haue done faire for him, and hees now not a little proud of himſelfe. This hath God done for him, he hath wrought Good out of Euill: this hath he done vnto himſelfe, he hath wrought Euill out of Good. Tis ſtrange how Vice here buds from Vertue.
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:3139:90"/> 
               <hi>Whereas other Vices are in the Euill; our Pride on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is in the Good we haue: Other Euils openly ſhew the Worſt; this Euill tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherouſly ſpoyles the Beſt we doe. This is the craft and ſubtilty of the Deuill, that when be cannot at firſt preuent our Good Deeds, and Duties; hee ſeekes to preuent them af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, by making vs Proud of what we haue done. The Vertues that deſtroy their ſeuerall Vices; he makes in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall to nouriſh this Vice: Prudence, Iuſtice, Forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:3139:91"/> Temperance; which baniſh and abandon Folly, Wrong, Faintneſſe, Riot: Theſe neuertheleſſe (and ſuch others) occaſion Pride, and cheriſh it. Of all our Vertues, this is the chiefeſt; not to be Proud of our Vertues.</hi> Hee built a Schoole, Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, Hoſpitall; and I read his name in euery Window. Tuſh! he hath erected him an euerlaſting Monument of Letters: in whoſe very Frontiſpeece, you may read at once both his Name, and Works: And
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:3139:91"/> you muſt conceiue, theſe were not ſet ſo neere together for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing: his Name does authorize his Workes; and his Workes immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talize his Name. Hee ſmiles to thinke, how his Name is publiſhed, in the inquiry of his Works; and how his Workes are graced, in the mention of his Name. He hath long learn't to exhauſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, like a Bee: and now at length hath got the Are to euiſcerate himſelfe, like a Spider.
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:3139:92"/> Others Brood he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly wraps in his owne Clouts; with here and there a new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fangled Brat, much what like himſelfe: and yet he hugges them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue thereſt; and ſayes of his owne inuenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; O deepe Notions, and myſterious! Orare, and pious Thoughts! Oh how it tickles him to re-repeat the Line, and Saying, hee hath couched ſo Emphati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally! when as (per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps) you can ſcarce conceiue it to be ſo
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:3139:92"/> much as ſenſibly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted. Iuſt like a fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſticke Muſician, he chiefly pleaſes himſelfe; while hee leaues the Grounds, to run vpon his Voluntaries. <hi>How readily, and raſhly, doe we broach our owne Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions? how largely pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raphraſe vpon our owne Fancies? yea, wee make them ours alſo; which be no other, than haue beene ſaid, or thought, ſaue ſomewhat otherwiſe. That we haue made a bare ſhift to clad, or cloake ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; this is enough to
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:3139:93"/> owne it to our ſelues. The Authour boaſts what cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Threed he hath ſo cunningly wouen from out himſelfe, nor (for his Matter, or Method) hath he the leaſt hint from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The Tranſlatour tels you, tis farre more te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious to confine his wits to conſtruction, than to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large them to Inuention. He bragges of the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rainers Learning, and Deuotion; together with his narrow inquiry of his Words, and minde: and now hee compares his Turn'd Coat (though in

I cannot tell what you would ſay he may be; but he will not (he ſayes) bee a Foole in Print. He vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braids him with Folly, that thinkes himſelfe knowes nothing, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe others know what he knowes: and thinks it his owne Diſcretion, not to communicate his knowledge vnto Fooles.

You haue many of his Sect, and Sort: He ſeemes lowly, but he grudges to be deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; He cares not to bepoore, but he is loth to want: He goes bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, fares hardly, lies coldly; an holy Man (I wis) and mortifi'd! but that he boaſts as much of this, as you could of the Contrary. <hi>A fained Humility, puffes vp more, then a noted Pride: and is ſo much the more euill and edious, as it ſeemes to bee otherwiſe.</hi>
               <pb n="161" facs="tcp:3139:95"/> Tuſh man!

Theſe are the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled waters, in which we cannot ſee our faces, and ſhapes: nay, in which we wallow purpoſely, that we may not ſee them. Theſe are the dusky Clouds, that obſcure the Sunne of our little world, our Reaſon. If theſe boyſterous Winds get head againſt vs; they trouble our Sea, perplex our Pilot, ſplit our Ship, and driue vs all to wrack.</hi> But I ſay no more to my Selfe. <hi>We may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayle our Selues in O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; it is in vaine, that

            <p>But ſoft; not too neare him. The man turnes bigge, and ſower vpon me. He ſeem'd Impatient at the firſt; and now growes Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious at a next affront. <hi>Anger is wont to reſiſtand aſſault thoſe it meets with, as thoſe it aymes at: and growes as ſhort againſt the meane occurrences, as againſt the maine Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite.</hi>
               <pb n="206" facs="tcp:3139:118"/> See, ſee! Hee's all on a froth and fume. Looke on him well, and like him worſe. His Head ſtartles, Haires bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, Browes wrinkle, Eyes ſparkle, Teeth chatter, Tongue ſtam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers, lips quauer, Ioynts tremble, Hands clap, Fingers twitter, Feet wander: His Bloud ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, Stomacke fills, veines ſwell; His Heart burnes, Breaſt boyles, Breath ſhortens, and his Colour goes and comes: Now red as fire, now pale as a clout;
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:3139:118"/> now raſhly hot and fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, now fearefully wanne and chill. What vncouth alterations of Mind? Did you euer ſee ſuch franticke anticke geſtures of Body? In this Glaſſe (I warne you all) behold, and abhorre yourſelues. Did he here alſo ſee himſelfe, he would ſcarce know himſelfe; yet ſcarce that, ere loath himſelfe. The Man quite marres a good Face of his owne. <hi>How vncomely and loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome is his Mind now</hi> (could you marke it)
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:3139:119"/> 
               <hi>that workes theſe diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, and diſtractions in his Body?</hi> He ſeemes (me thinkes) as vgly, as out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious: and his Feature not more vnſeemely, than his Feats. Marke him now: Now he ſtands, now ſtarts, now ſtampes, now Stares, now ſhrugges, now ſcratches, now ſnuffes, now grinnes, now gapes, now wrings. Such Apiſh tricks, ſuch Bedlam prancks; as you would iudge him (in his Fitt) either a Foole, or or madman: And who
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:3139:119"/> will thinke you other in his caſe? <hi>Anger is a ſhort madneſſe. Ah peeuiſh paſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that thus diſtempers and diſtracts vs! of all our hard and aduerſe Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, the moſt harſh and churliſh. The reſt haue ſome eaſement; this only will no mitigation. Feare hath ſome Bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; Sorrow ſome Ioy; Deſpayre ſome Hope; this Fury only hath no mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. They moue vs, but this inrages: They diſturbe, but this confounds our quiet.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet more tricks with
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:3139:120"/> this angry Ape? Come a loft Iack: Sirrah? How doe your fellow Brutes ſtartle and beſtirre them in a moued mood? See the Sport: He now rampes like a Lion, bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles like a Boare, fomes like a Beare, kicks like a Horſe, ſtampes like a Bull, puſhes like a Ram, grinnes like a Dogge, ſcratches like a Cat, ſwels like a Toad, hiſſes like a Snake, bills like a Cocke, tugges like a Gooſe, buzzes like a Beetle, ſtings like a Waſpe, and now
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:3139:120"/> mumpes and mowes like himſelfe. Nay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Iacke. He now bends his browes, gnaſhes his teeth, ſcrat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches his head, teares his haire, beats his breaſt, wrings his hands, ſmites the poſt with his fiſt, and ſpurns the duſt before him with his feet. The an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry Ape ſaid I? I ſhould haue ſaid the Ape of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. There is no ſauage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of Beaſts, which he here imitates not, if not exceeds. Nay, hee'le follow the very Fiends
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:3139:121"/> in his fury. <hi>Man is in nothing more Brutiſh</hi> (I yet ſay not Deuilliſh) <hi>than in his Anger.</hi> He is well compared, to what he ſo well reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles. I ſhall thinke him neither better, nor o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than a Beaſt; that ſuffers his ſenſleſſe paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to blinde and ſway the Reaſon of a Man. No better than a Beaſt? Much worſe. <hi>A Beaſt knowes not how to be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry: Anger is the Anger of a man. Mans is the ſin; a Beaſts is but the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, and ſhape of Anger:
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:3139:121"/> A Beaſt oft ſhewes the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence; a Man only hath the vice thereof: Such (perhaps) ſeize, wound, kill; roare, and bray, bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low and bleat: yet forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with (for all the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, or Sorrow) fall to Feed, or Sleepe: He only hath this Ground, and Grudge within him. And hereupon, no Man but prone, no Beaſt but loth to be prouoked: It ſtriues ſtill to ſhunne, what he oft thirſts to iucurre.</hi>

            <p>My Friend, be faire condition'd; tis beſt for you to know, and
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:3139:122"/> loue your ſelfe. Nay my haughty Haire-braines, tis no piſhing, tuſhing, laughing, ſcowling, ſcoffing, ſcorning mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Scorne thou my Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, while I pity thy Scorne. Another hath wronged thee; alas! and alas that thou therefore wrongſt thy ſelfe: Thou needs muſt vex thy ſelfe, becauſe another hath vexed thee. I had thought (howeuer) that thou couldſt not ſo haue ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Another, as not to loue thy Selfe. But
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:3139:122"/> what careſt thou, how thou hazards thee, to hurt him. A Bee hath ſtung thee, and thou'lt pull the whole Hiue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout thy eares: yea (ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Bee!) thy ſelfe wilt alſo ſting, though in the loſſe of thy Sting, thou loſe thy Life. Thou'lt throw thy Dare howeuer, though more by that meanes light vpon thee. It is nothing, if thou periſh in his ruine. Ah ſilly Fencer! but naked, and yet ſpightfull in thy Frayes; that lookeſt
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:3139:123"/> only where to hit the the other, not where to guard thy ſelfe. <hi>An an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry Man is his owne worſt enemy; and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fends none more than himſelfe: Hee is often more crucified in the Thirſt; than the other damnified in the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Reuenge. Anger is a Fury, that rightly haunts the heart, that harbours it: a Viper that worthily gnawes the wombe, that doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue it. It is but iuſt, that an inordinate Mind and froward, ſhould be a
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:3139:123"/> Plague, a Torment, a Danger, a Deſtruction to it ſelfe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I haue caſt thy Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: Ile tell thee what thou feeles, which (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thou feeles) thou canſt not tell. Thy Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe is the ſpice of an Ague; commonly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Phyſicians Shame; which euery Man is here to himſelfe. The Ground is a chole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricke Humour, the Seat a naughty Stomack, the Cauſe a bad Digeſtion, of hard meats eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally; the Signe a Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:3139:124"/> a Shaking Fit; the Effects a Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of the Body, and a Diſtraction of the Mind: the Cure is, to be let bloud in a Wilde Veine, to purge gently for Choler, to abſtaine from ſharpe and bitter Prouocations, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply thy ſtomacke only with pleaſant and eaſie Leniments. Nay if you take it not in time, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the third Fit at the furtheſt; it growes to more Diſeaſes, than I can either Cure, or Count. Then is it the
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:3139:124"/> Inflaming of the Bloud, the Swimming of the Braine, the Blearing of the Eyes, the Burning of the Heart, the Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of the Stomacke, the Shaking of the Hands: Strifes Inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, and loues Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pilation; the Drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie of Indignities, and Conſumption of all Humanity. The Minds Extaſie, caſting Reaſon in a trance: the Bodies Lethargie, lulling the ſenſe aſleepe. Name me any thing thats bad; and it is no
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:3139:125"/> better. A roaring Lion, a rauening Wolfe, a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uage Tigre, a wilde Boare, a ſhe Beare, an vntamed Beaſt, an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brideled Horſe, an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yoked Oxe, an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taught Ape: a Cloud, a Wind, a Showre, a Storme, a Sea, a Waue, a Gulfe, a Rocke, a Wracke; a Racke, a Pit, a Hell. All the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments out of their ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. A conſuming Fire, a peſtilent Ayre, a troubled Water, and a quaking Earth. Thus can I call it all thats
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:3139:125"/> bad; and what ſhall I ſay to thee? <hi>A foule euill is Anger, and egre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious. Theres no Euill, which it either cauſes not, or matches not. What Euils to Strifes, Enuies, Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders? and whence are they? What Euills doe men beyond it: and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt vs Men, What Euils are done beſide it?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thou knowſt (per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps) nor it, nor thy ſelfe, by theſe Names of mine: or lou'ſt rather not to heare on't in harſh tearmes. I now come to thee; thus
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:3139:126"/> mince it with thee. It is forſooth (as you com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly call it) an Haſty nature: So; its thus knowne in all: but how call you it each in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? Oh, tis the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers Stoutneſſe, the Miniſters Earneſtneſſe, the Womans Pettiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, the Sicke-mans Peeuiſhnes, the Young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans Raſhneſſe, the Old-mans Teſtineſſe, the Priuate-mans Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, and the Great mans Diſpleaſure. Be it ſo in the Seueralls; what is it yet in the Summe: E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:3139:126"/> man in his Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour; and yet but one Humour in euery Man. <hi>Are Sinnes leſſe, for the varietie of Names, and Subiects? Anger may be more impotent in one than other; yet is it not leſſe euill. We all haue not our Might anſwerable to our Mood. It is with more Rancour, than Power, that the very Waſpe ſtings, and Worme turnes againe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But its good (and it be but to ſharpen a mans wits) to be angry a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, now and then. Why not better, to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:3139:127"/> more? A Good thing is not Ill, becauſe it is more. The Thing is meerely euill, whoſe Increaſe may make it worſe. Vertues onely know a meane: Vices haue a more or leſſe. <hi>A leſſe Euill hath not more Benefit, but leſſe Danger: A leſſe Anger, is a leſſe Euill; it there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Profits not more, but hurts leſſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Who I angry at thee? at thy Anger rather: Nor angry at thy An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger I. It is not fitting a Fault ſhould take vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:3139:127"/> it, to correct a Fault. Yet let me ſay; Zeale, and Iuſtice, reprehend and puniſh, with ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtneſſe, with ſeuerity; not rage, not cruelty The Philoſopher would not ſmite his Seruant, becauſe he was angry: nor (were I ſo) would I chide thee. <hi>We are not angry at him, to whom we would the Amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of euill, together with the puniſhment. Is the Law therefore angry, becauſe it conuicts, the Iudge becauſe hee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnes, the Officer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:3139:128"/> hee executes the Malefactor? It is Pietie that moues here, not In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmitie. The ſword of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice is not put into a Mad mans hand. Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie requires not a raſh, a lawleſſe rigour; to what a graue, and iuſt ſeuerity can execute. Are Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates ſet for Poſts, and Cyphers; idle, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moueable? It is the Spurre of their Office, that now moues them: They are angry at Enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities; the very Cauſe is enough, to exempt it from that Name: It is not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbation
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:3139:128"/> now, but indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. Take away this ſpirit and life of the Common Wealth; and each ciuill Society faints in dulneſſe and heartleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; yea groanes vnder diſorder, confuſedneſſe and ruine. Theſe may ſin, in being not angry: Theſe may <q rend="inline large">bee angry and ſinne not:</q> Thou both art angry, and ſinneſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>True, true; The Ant (I know) hath her gall, the Flie her ſpleene, and the Worme will turne againe. Nature (I haue
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:3139:129"/> learned) hath giuen to all Creatures a deſire and endeuour to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue them ſelues in their proper Being: and hence it is they ſo reſiſt, or auoid whatſoeuer may oppoſe, or endanger it. <hi>Euen vileſt Creatures wax offended, at what may moleſt their peace and ſafety: How much rather then is the nobleſt Creature diſpleaſed at in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuries, at indignities? A Man is worthily moued at his Friends Wrong, and his owne: and a Chriſtian (aboue all) at
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:3139:129"/> his Gods Diſhonour.</hi> But what a Man is he, that will wrangle with a Worme; that will fight with a Flie; that a Mouſe can moue him? We haue ſuch a ſort of touchy Spirits; whoſe Tinder hearts, apt to receiue the leaſt Sparke of a Flinty offence; kindle forthwith the Match of Contention. Like Thunder and Lightning, a Cracke and a Flaſh, a Word and a Blow, The Deuill (I thinke.) at firſt extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted. Salt-Peter from

Theres a Sparke, all Fire and Tow; euery blaſt of breath is the Bellowes to kindle him: and euery.

Say no thing oppoſe him
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:3139:130"/> hee'le yet be at oddes with himſelfe. <hi>Anger is oft impatient, euen of Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruance: and longs to be croft, that ſo it may get to vent it ſelfe.</hi> Say ſtill as he ſayes, to ſooth him; yet hee'le haſtily bid you (as <hi>Caelius</hi> the <hi>Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour</hi> bade his yeelding <hi>Client</hi>) ſay ſomewhat againſt him; that ſo you may be knowne to be one beſide him. Hee'le wrangle with you for Goats haire, and ſtand againſt you for a Straw. Pinnes, and Points, are enough to

He takes it in high diſdaine, you ſo careleſly bedaſht his Doublet; and vowes to be euen with you, ſince you hapt to tread vpon his Toes. You haue either taken the Wall, or not pledg'd the Health; and he muſt needs fight with you. He frets and fumes at his Fortune; Curſes and conjures the Deuill, and the Witch; bites, and burnes Cards and Dice, and now he is ſatisfied in a ſilly reuenge. <hi>There
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:3139:131"/> is no Trifle, which a Wiſe man cannot laugh at; or a Foole be angry at.</hi> Rather than his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuries ſhall be vnreuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged; hee'le purſue the Waſpe that ſtung him, bawle with the Dogge that barks at him, beat the Wind that blowes in his face, fight with the Poſt that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands him, and ſpurne the very Stone he ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles at.

We are eaſily angry, but at what we know not: Something ſeemes to wrong vs, and we haue ſome deſire of reuenge.
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:3139:132"/> It is a ſhadow of Offence, that moues vs; and a ſhadow of Amends, will ſtill vs. A but counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited Appeaſement, is enough to a but conceited Indignation.</hi>

            <p>I am ſummoned, challenged, yea cowar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with indignities: and yet I lothly enter the liſts of Strife; or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther enter not.

I will winke at the Childe, and Old man, for the weakneſſe of their Age; at the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, for her Sex; at the Foole, and Mad-man, for their Condition. Yet ſo, as to let them know,
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:3139:166"/> it was not well done, but rather taken ſo. <hi>This is a Mans both quiet, and renowne; that he can forbeare. His Mildneſſe ſhall pacifie his Aduerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, while they cannot but wonder at it; ſhall proeure him Friends, while they needs muſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>My Affections are in my Cuſtodie, and ſhall keepe within my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe. I will ſo hold the reines, as that I can curbe, or looſe them; not ſo much when it is my pleaſure, but when
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:3139:166"/> I ſee my time. <hi>We muſt leaue our liues, if we will auoid Offences: And of theſe, though many (when they come) may be borne with; yet are not all to be neglected.</hi> We cannot (oft times) but be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued at the Euill of things. I that muſt loue my neighbour as my Selfe: may notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding ſo hate his Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, as mine owne. <hi>An vnreaſonable Patience, is little better than an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate Anger.</hi> This kind of Dulneſſe would not only incourage the
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:3139:167"/> Bad, but euen incite the Good, to doe euill. <hi>The Zeale of a Man is ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moured of the Vertuous; nor can it be but diſpleaſed at the Vicious Diſpleaſed, not at the Party, but his Vice: Diſpleaſed at the Euill he hath done; not ſo much becauſe hee hath now ſo done, but rather that hee may doe ſo no more.</hi> I now can be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry; yet ſo, as my Anger be not a worſe Fault, than the Fault I am an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry at.

<pb n="303" facs="tcp:3139:167"/> I am now prouo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, but becauſe I now ought ſo to be. If (while I diſpute againſt Anger) a ſaucy Fellow ſhould ſpit in my Face, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely to prouoke mee: I would not now doubt (with <hi>Diogenes</hi>) whether I ought ſo to be? but let him truly and iuſtly know, and feele, I am angry; for ſo I ought.</p>
            <p>But if this Paſſion (as it is wont in moſt) proue exorbitant, and fall to range (yea and rage) beyond her Pale;

Thus is it awhile delayed, thus allayed at the laſt. Withdraw but the Fewell of Raſhneſſe from this Paſſion, and the Fire is abated: Let but the Sun of Reaſon ſhine vpon it, and the Miſt is vaniſhed. <hi>Ah the

It is ſtrange to thinke, how Anger one way deferred, languiſhes: although ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way prolonged, it is the rather enraged. Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chitas, Socrates, Plato;</hi> theſe were but Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, yet would not ſo much as beat their Seruants in their Anger: Shall I that am a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, riſe now againſt
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:3139:169"/> my Brother? Shall my Stomacke ſerue others one way, as I (another way) would ſerue my Stomacke: onely eat when I am hungry; only beat when I am angry? By no meanes. I am wiſer, than to launch forth in a ſtorme: If he haue offended mee, if prouoked mee; the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence will notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding remaine, when the Prouocation ſhall bee paſt. Theres no hurt to take another, and better time, to puniſh, or admoniſh: I ſhall ſo

What profit haue you? What credit? to commit that ſuddenly, which you may repent at leiſure. Many a Man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe hee hath beene ſo cauſeleſly angry at Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; hath had cauſe enough (after) to be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry at Himſelfe.

            <p>Weariſh Wretch; ſo like a Flea-biter hee lookes.

<pb n="325" facs="tcp:3139:179"/> tall Hat, and tatterd Cloake, Threed-bare Buskins, and cobbled Shooes; a ſwagging Pouch, and a Spadle-ſtaffe: And if you rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon him onely by his Coat, and Carcaſſe; one would ſcarce beſtow the hanging of him, to haue them both. They ſay commonly, <hi>ill Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, ill Manners:</hi> but here certainly <hi>ill Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, ill Members.</hi> For (could you ſee into him) he is not more ill-fauoured, than ill-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditioned: Theres cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:3139:180"/> more vglineſſe in him, than appeares by him: A mind more mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhapen, than can be fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gured in a Carcaſſe neuer ſo disfigured. <hi>How mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous a Vice is Auarice, and odious? It diſtorts the Body, and diſtracts the Soule: Is Natures very Enormity, and an vtter Anomie to Grace; here quite ſweruing, there farre out of frame. It makes a Man looke vgly, and to be loathed; but odious inwardly, and to be abhorred: makes him ſeeme a Monſter on the
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:3139:180"/> outſide; but makes him a very Deuill within.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Flocke here my pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Birds; heres an ill fac't Owle, will finde you all worke to won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at. See how ſtrid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling hee ſtands; hee couches and crouches vpon his Staffe; nor lookes he at you, but vnder his elbow: and ſay what you will; he neuer ſpeakes but when his mouth is open. Come on then, looke and laugh, and hollow, and whoot, and whiſtle, and hiſſe; gibe and
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:3139:181"/> jeſt, frumpe and flour, point and play: heres a broad Butt to hit, and an Aſſes backe to beare all. It were good ſport, to laugh and ſcorne him out of his skinne, for his Coyne. Loe the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerous Carle! what a needy Niggard it is? Oh tis a ſcraping Churle! Out on him greedy Gripe! A very Gut-head, he hath Aſſes Eares direct; a Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head &amp; it were to ſet his Leekes on; He ſees well, and his Eyes were vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſt; I wonder he is
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:3139:181"/> not ring'd for rooting; you may ſee your face in his ſo tranſparant Cheekes; a Head he hath like a Moule, and his nailes were growne; and a Foot to ſhouell the Street before him. <hi>Hatefull Miſereant! how hath he worne and wre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted himſelfe from Gods good Making?</hi> His ſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Hat hath harboured many a Thouſand; and his woollen Cap ſcrues to keepe warme his Wits. His weather-bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Cloake he had by Inheritance; and hee
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:3139:182"/> meanes to make it in his Will. He hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got the Making of his Doublet; but it puls him (euer and anon) in minde of repairing. His Breeches are in the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion, not ſo much for pride, as to ſaue Cloth. But how bare ſoeuer be his Backe, and belly thinne; his Bagge is well lin'd, and he keeps it warme. Theres not a hole in his Hoſe, and yet not a place where there hath not beene a hole. His ſhooes haue coſt him more the
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:3139:182"/> maintaining, than would prouide him Shooes. He keepes a free houſe; you may as ſoone breake your Necke, as your Faſt: and a cleane withall; you may as readily wet your Shoos, as your Lips. The Man is oft-times ſo melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly at Home; that he is glad when he may cheare vp himſelfe at his Neighbours Boord: And (vpon many occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions) growes ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate, that hee cares not what becomes of him; only he is loth to
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:3139:183"/> be at the charges of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king himſelfe away. What chattering about a Night-Bird? and who can keepe Countenance at ſo abſurd an Obiect? <hi>Couetouſneſſe is as well worthy Scorne, as Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred: and the Folly there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of as much to be laughed at, as the Iniquity to be abborred. God, and Men, haue thought Vice not odious only; but ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous. Whom God hath ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horred, them alſo hath he laughed to ſcorne. The Couetous eſpecially, haue beene oftner counted, and
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:3139:183"/> called Fooles, than Fiends. Ironies are an approued Rhetoricke, and an earneſt Argument againſt Impieties. And ſome Euils are more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitably derided, than re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In good ſooth (for all this) he lookes but ſparing on't. Whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer he lacks of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; You would iudge him a mortified Man according to the Fleſh. He forbeares oft-times to feed ſo full as Nature requires; Though Grace was neuer in his mouth
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:3139:184"/> or minde, either before meat, or after. Hee ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome cats but ſparing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; though temperate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly neuer. Thereaſon of all is, becauſe he ſo eats, not to ſubdue his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die; but to ſaue his Meat. Like <hi>Tantalus,</hi> he ſtands vp in Water to the chinne, and Apples hang by cloſters hard at his Lips; and yet hee pinches and pines in the midſt of meat and drinke. An artificiall Chymicke; he hath true <hi>Mydaſſes</hi> Touch: all that he ſhould eat and
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:3139:184"/> drinke, he turnes into Gold: I would hee had <hi>Mydaſſes</hi> Eares withall, it would make him more knowne, and laughed at. Like one that ſold a Ratt for two hundred Pence, and dyed of Hunger himſelfe: ſo will he oft times ſtarue his carcaſſe, to crambe his Pouch. <hi>A Couetous Mans Mind is a ſlaue to his Mony; and his Body a ſtaue-to his Mind: He will not ſatisfie the Appetite of the one; becauſe the other hath an Appetite wil not be ſatisfied. Oh baſeneſſe of
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:3139:185"/> Men! to vnder-value their Affections to baſe Droſſe; and their Liues to baſe Affections. Ah their Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and Wretchednes! to haue the Creatures of God, and vſe them not; which they therefore haue, to vſe: to preferre their Wealth to their Health, their Gettings to their Beings, their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to their Body; their Gold to their God, their Siluer to their Soule; and rather poſſeſſe it, than en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy themſelues.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Suppoſe him now ſet at anothers Table: His
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:3139:185"/> Knife (anſwerable to his Stomacke) is the firſt drawne, and not the laſt in the Diſh. Now not a word with him: Aske him any thing; and he anſwers all with Yea, and No; not aboue a monoſylla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble at the moſt. Looke how hee loads a Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed Trencher? His Cheekes ſtrut, Teeth walke, and Chaps plie apace: And leſt you might hap to cut him, not where he likes not, but not enough; hee ſaues you the labour of
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:3139:186"/> a Carner. He now feeds full vpon Free-Coſt: and ſayes with <hi>Diogenes,</hi> That Wine is beſt, and moſt pleaſant to him, which he payes not for. Now makes hee a full amends to his whining Stomacke, and his Guts leaue grumbling: But as the Wolfe eats one good Meale for three Dayes: ſo though hee feaſt his Body now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad; hee will make the poore Carcaſſe pay triple for it at Home. Yea and (all this while) if his Hoſt be beholden
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:3139:186"/> to him for more than his Company; he eats double: out eats him, and eats him out. <hi>The Couetous is one of a raue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous Generation: A very Harpy, Tigre, Wolfe, Beare, Dogge, Deuill, Pit, Gulfe, and Hell. A Cormorant begat him; <q rend="inline large">The Daughter of the Horſleach</q> bare him: and he like a curſed Cater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piller, is continually gnaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: Deuouring Widowes houſes, and ſucking the very Bloud from the hearts of the Fatherleſſe.
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:3139:187"/> Oh all ye damned Deuou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers! that eat vp Gods people, as if it were Bread, Bloud-ſuckers of <hi>BELI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>AL!</hi> Surfeit yet a while in your helliſh Inſaciacie: Ye ſhall once ſpue out your Bowels; and empty your ſelues into a Pit as bottomleſſe, as euer were your deſires.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I will home with him, and ſee what an Houſe he keeps. Let me tell you, he keepes an open Houſe: but you may vnderſtand, it is the Roofe vnthatcht, or Windowes vntrelleſſed;
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:3139:187"/> for the Doore is neuer vnbolted. The Graſſe growes greene vpon his Threſhold; and his Dog is as good as a Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to keepe Beggars from his Doore. His Chimney ſmokes but ſeldome, and Dawes make neſts in euery corner. You cannot come to viſit his Beere, but you ſhall finde it at a very low rate, low eſtate, if not dead out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right: And for his Bread, Age and Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence haue brought it to an hoary head. He is
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:3139:188"/> now at his owne Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and marke how his Boord is furniſhed: His ſtall and Garnor furniſht the Market, and that his Coffers: his Garden-plot only fills his Table, &amp; that fils his Belly. Roots and Herbs he cals his Firſt, and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Courſe: and three hungry Sallets ſupply the places of ſo many hearty Seruices. He cuts vp a Carrot, and pickes out a dainty bit in a Turnep: Beets are his beſt Fare; and he thinks how he riots amongſt
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:3139:188"/> his Leekes and Lettice? He ſhiues out his Bread by weight or meaſure; an Ounce, or an Inch; and at euery Cutting obſerues the Loafe. You would thinke he hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred his Morſels: Hee goes ſo farre, and no further; not becauſe he would eat no more, but would no more ſhould be eaten. He eats the more Pottage on purpoſe, to ſpare the Fleſh. He ſeldome eats like an Epicure, to pleaſe his Palate; neuer like a Man, to nouriſh

He may eat Gold; and yet hee feeds but groſſely. Like a Tradeſman, that ſells off his beſt wares at a good rate; and keepes the worſt for his owne vſe: Or like him, that ſells out the good Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quour; and reſerues the Dregges for his owne drinking: Like an Idi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ot, he hath the beſt to chuſe on, and makes choice only of the worſt;
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:3139:190"/> Leaues the good for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and takes the bad vnto himſelfe: Or like That Aſſe, that carried dainty Cates vpon his backe; and notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding fill'd his belly with Hay, and Straw. But if he be a Worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Miſer, and of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient ſtanding; Not the Cogniſance only, but the Coat alſo is the ſelfe ſame, his Great Grand-ſire gaue before him. He muſt doe, as his Father before him; or elſe how ſhould he vphold the Houſe?
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:3139:191"/> Now hath be more Dogges, than Men to wait vpon him: and his Table fills more Eares, than Bellies; and more fils Eares, than Bellies. He now quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters a Capon, and roaſts halfe a Rabbet: and tels you an old Tale of an Hare, and another of a Pigge, that was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion'd to three ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Spits, Fires, Dayes, Diſhes, Meales: But an approued Story, how that the Loyne of a Cocke was once a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice for a King. His
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:3139:191"/> Taylour hath not halfe ſo many wayes to turne his Breeches, as his Cooke to dreſſe his Diſhes: he ſends vp the ſame Diſh ſeuen dayes together, diſguiſed only in ſeuen ſeuerall Sauces. And for the cold Pie, it is ſo long ſince it came hot out of the Ouen; that it hath got on a Freize coat to keep it warme: and at laſt is faine to flit from his Table, to his Trough. He grudges to beſtow any thing vpon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe; and brawles with
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:3139:192"/> Wife and Children, as the daily meanes of his vndoing: And when he muſt needs diſpend, he ſhrugges it out, and kiſſes euery Peece he parts from. <hi>How ſhould a Couetous Man be good to any? ſince he is not ſo to himſelfe. Will he feed the hungry; whoſe owne Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke ſtill complaines? Will he cloath the naked; that only ſhrouds him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in ſhreds? Will hee giue to the Poore; that cannot be perſwaded him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe is rich? Well he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue others Neceſsities;
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:3139:192"/> that thinks there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing beſide him, which he wants not himſelfe? Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable Earth-load is he; borne to doe good to none, no not himſelfe.

            </p>
            <p>Tis bed time by this; and (not once minding, or mentioning his God) hee commends himſelfe to the keeping
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:3139:193"/> of his Bolts and Barres. Wife, Children, Friends, Seruants, he askes them all once, and againe, if they haue made all ſure? and being accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly anſwered, he yet riſes at laſt to reſolue himſelfe. <hi>Than the Coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous Man, none more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſtfull.

How to dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble his Talent by the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt meanes, and in the

Who is now the Rich man of the World, that is not richer in Plagues, than he is in Poſſeſsions: That a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounds not in Reſtleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, more than in Reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues. It was a Wiſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge of One, alwayes to inrich his Enemies, and Offenders: affirming, it was puniſhment enough to make them rich: mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Wealth can want no Woe; and he that hath great Riches, hath little Reſt withall.

In the Worlds eye, he is the Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Man that hath Houſe by Houſe, Field by Field, Flocke by Flocke, Bagge by Bagge, and Cheſt by Cheſt. He goes cloathed in purple and fine Linnen, and fares deliciouſly euery day: Fine fed, and gay clad; His Cates and Rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments both farre fetcht,
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:3139:203"/> and deare bought: and the Subſtance and Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of neither are thought good enough for him; but both are made better, if Coſt and Art can make them ſo.

An honeſt poore Man would not haue the rich Gluttons Eſtate, to haue his Mind. The one hath little, and wants lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle; the other wants as much as he hath: The

A man indeed is he of a daily deuotion, but of no Religion: for he ſcarce comes to Church aboue once a Quarter. What need he trauell to ſacrifice; or come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad to worſhip? hee hath a Chappell in his Cheſt, and a God of his owne, his MAMMON. Each Part of his Body, and Power of his Soule;
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:3139:205"/> hath he commanded, (as did that <hi>King</hi> his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects) that they forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with fall downe, and worſhip the GOIDEN-IMAGE. Hee ſcornes and contemnes blinde, and ſluggiſh: BAAL, Aſſe-headed AN A ME<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LECH; DAGON the deceitfull; and the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercifull MOLECH: calls BAAL-ZEBVB but a Flie-catcher; and thinks BELL and DRA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GON but Gluttons both. He cals none Good, but God: and of Gods, none more than
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:3139:206"/> MAMMON, the God of Goods. Other Gods are either chargeable, or not beneficiall; but as for him (to make good the Deuills words) hee ſerues not his God for nought: Only he is oft times perplexe; leſt (with LABAN) he might at any time loſe his God: His God (he knowes) is Currant; and therefore tis his greateſt care to keepe it. Yea and his Gods are ſo many of the ſame Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and Mould; that all his Seruice is to num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:3139:206"/> them. Hee makes much of his Mony, for the Figures ſake, more than for the Vſe: and thinks he hath it to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groſſe, rather than to imploy. Euery New Peece is a new Picture of his Worſhip: which at firſt he examines by the Balance of his beſt Beleefe; and after ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits it as an Image of his Adoration. <hi>
                  <hi>HE</hi> well ſaw his Superſtition, who called the Couetous Man an <hi>IDOLATOVR.</hi> Why did God oppoſe himſelfe to <hi>MAMMON?</hi> but

<pb n="379" facs="tcp:3139:207"/> odious, than the other. Nor is the Couetous Man more ſpiritually Idolatrous; than ciuilly Slauiſh. The Droſſe is but baſe; but the Couetous Mans af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections are baſer than the Droſſe: Elſe, how could he vnder-value himſelfe to it? vnleſſe he ſaw ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what in it, more worthy than himſelfe. They call him the Mony-Maſter; butyou may call it the Maſter-Money: For which he toyles Night and Day; bides Heat and Cold; runnes through Fire and Water; hazards
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:3139:208"/> Body and Soule. Silly Slaue! thus to become a Drudge to his Seruant: As not poſſeſsing, but poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed rather; not vſing it, but imployed himſelfe: not daring to diſpend it, as a Maſter ouer it; but faine to guard it, as a Seruant to it: whereof he hath the trouble only of the Cuſtody; but no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of the Inioyment.</hi>

When Men will not labour, for that is painfull; when Men will not venter, for that is doubtfull: But will rather defraud and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumuent, taking it to be eaſily and certainly gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full: Hauing neither the Patience, nor Honeſty to expect, till Time, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry may aduantage them; But hauing a reach beyond both, to riſe of a Sudden: And ſo they be haſtily, they care not

            <p>Nay but I now come neere the Man, that is ſo neare himſelfe. Why (God be thanked) Man, thou haſt enough. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough? No, no; For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune hath giuen to him (as ſhe hath to Many) too much: but hath not giuen him (as ſhee hath to None) Enough. Enough 3 Theres two of the Enoughs (hee ſayes) and his (hee thinkes) is little E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough. It mattereth not, how much hee hath with another;
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:3139:215"/> ſith it ſeemes but ſmall vnto himſelfe. Little, or Much, it skilleth not; Little would haue no leſſe, and Much would ſtill haue more. And therefore, his Hooke hangs continually, and all is Fiſh, that comes to his Net: He hath a Plow in euery Mans Field; an Iron in euery mans Fire; and an Oare in euery mans Boat. Like a hungry Dogge, he gapes at euety Bit, and ſnatches at euery Bone: Like a greedy Kite, ere hee haue yet
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:3139:216"/> quite ſwallowed the firſt gobbet; he gapes and creekes for another: At once puls one Hand vnto him, with what he hath gotten, and keeps cloſe his Fiſt; and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens the other Hand, and holds it out for more. He labours of a Diſeaſe, the remedy whereof does rather in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe the malady: a Feuer, a Dropſie, a Dog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſh Appetite. Meat makes him but hungry; and the more he drinks, the dryer he is; and all you can apply, addes
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:3139:216"/> but Fewell to augment his Fire. The Serpent <hi>Situla</hi> hath ſtung him, and (doe what you can) heele die of an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quenchable Thirſt. Powre in while you will, his Mouth is like a Sieue, or Tunnell; ſtill open and empty: and all that is put in, doth rather ſtretch out, than fill vp his Belly. <hi>All o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Deſires of men, reſt ſatisfied in their accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment: This hungry deſire of Hauing only, the more it is fulfilled, it is enlarged. The Beaſts
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:3139:217"/> can forthwith ſuffice their Appetites, only this beaſtly Appetite of Man will not bee ſatisfi'd What ſhall I call this Couetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe? a Ditch, a Graue, a Gulfe, a Whore, a Hell: infinite all, and inſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate altogether. <q rend="inline large">The Daughter of the Horſeleach ſtill cries; Giue, Giue: but neuer ſaith, Jt is Enough.</q> He that lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth Siluer, is doomed not to bee ſatisfied with Siluer. For, Couetouſneſſe
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:3139:217"/> is the Hunger of the Soule; and Mony is but a corporall Suſtenance: It may well then fill his Purſe; but ſhall neuer ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice his Mind. The Coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous Man that loueth abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, ſhall not be ſatisfi'd with Increaſe: Becauſe the loue of his riches in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſeth together with the Heape. A Poore man hath little, and wants lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle: a Rich man hath much, and wants more than he hath. The One reſts content with what he hath; and thus is hee
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:3139:218"/>
                  <q rend="inline large">filled with good Things:</q> The Other coueteth to haue more; and ſo is he <q rend="inline large">ſent empty away.</q> How much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is it, to bee Full with little; than Empty in the midſt of much? And how are they Riches; which once increaſing, Pouerty is increaſed alſo? That Man is Rich, not that hath much; but that wants little: And he wants the leſſe, that hath the leaſt. He that hath but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, eſteemes well of a little Profit: but he that hath
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:3139:218"/> much, ſets light by a ſmall Gaine; becauſe he lookes for more. The Man that deſires many things, to him a Many things ſeeme a Few: but he that is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with few things, to him doe euen a Few things ſeeme a Many. A Beggar thinkes him rich with a Penny; a Rich man ſcarce thinkes him ſo with a Pound. Many a Man hath thought ſuch a Thing too much for him, before hee had it: which when hee hath, hee now thinkes it not enough. The Reaſon is, becauſe he ſo ſeekes to
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:3139:219"/> haue, as that he ſees not what he hath. Hee ſees not, how he hath, what others want: but thinks he wants, what another hath. What another hath, he wants; yea and wants what he hath himſelfe. But, he that will haue what he hath, and haue enough; Let him not get more, but craue leſſe: For the only way to make a Man Rich, is not to aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment his Subſtance; but rather leſſen his Deſire. He that eats much, and is not filled; that drinkes oft, and is not ſlaked: Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletion
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:3139:219"/> but increaſes the Malady; and there is no way to cure him, but by Purgation. A Man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not haue all that he will; this he may, he may nill what he hath not. He that would but a little, may ſoone haue all he would. I will deſire no more, when I would be ſure to haue my Deſire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What (I maruell) would the Man doe with more? Hee hath more already than is well beſtowed, or than he well knowes how to beſtow. It is his Goods
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:3139:220"/> Increaſe he minds only, not their Vſe. <hi>How vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy is be of the Talent, that binds it in a Nap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kin, and hides it in the Ground?

I'le anſwer for him; prouide for an hard Winter, and keepe in ſtore againſt a deare Yeare: (yea it is the thought of an hard Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, makes him he dare not inioy the Summer.)
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:3139:220"/> He will therefore (he ſayes) ſo dine, as he may ſup; and ſo goe to day, as he may to morrow. Yea (Oh miſery, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of Men!) therefore will he certainly ſcant himſelfe, leſt perhaps he may be ſcanted: and want that alwayes, which he feares he may ſometimes want. But would you know why he yet ſo ſcrapes and heapes? His moſt end is; He therfore would haue more, that others might haue leſſe: Otherwiſe, he is not ſatisfied, while
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:3139:221"/> there is any thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide him. Hee aduiſes himſelfe in this caſe (as a <hi>Tyrant</hi> did his Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers) to conſider how many things he wants; and to lee that no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther haue any thing but he. What he hath, doth himſelfe no good, doth others hurt: for he hath it purpolely to keepe it from others, rather than keepe it for himſelfe. Like the <hi>Dragon</hi> that kept the Golden Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples; and that other than kept the Golden Fleece: Like the <hi>Griffins</hi> in the
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:3139:221"/> 
               <hi>Hyperborean</hi> Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, that had no vſe of the Gold and preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Stones were there; yet would ſuffer none to take them thence. Or (to compare him with what hee's acquainted with) like a Dogge on a Hay-Mow, he lies there not to eat him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, but to keepe the Cattle from their Meat: Yea like a Daw, hides Mony, not that he hath need of it, but that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers might not find it. <hi>A Couetous Man doth good to none, no not himſelfe:
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:3139:222"/> doth hurt to himſelfe, and all. Wife, nor Children are the better for him; for whom Neighbours, and Strangers are the worſe. He counts it an indignitie, to haue Equals neere him; and a miſerie to haue Neighbours by him: And could wiſh there were no more men in the World but he: that ſo he might haue a World vnto himſelfe. <hi>ADAM</hi> (hee thinkes) was well bleſt, when there was no more to inhabit a whole Earth but hee: but now (hee ſayes) the World is
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:3139:222"/> waxt ſo populous, that men haue much adoe to liue one by another. His endleſſe coueting hath made his Poſſeſsions boundleſſe: And yet (hee thinkes) he ſcarce hath enough; when hee now knowes not what he hath. I will now ſay to him, and all; and ſo as my words are warranted: <q rend="inline large">Goe to now ye rich Men (ye that ioyne Houſe to Houſe, and Field to Field; till there be no roome left for
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:3139:223"/> the Poore) weepe, and howle for your miſeries that ſhall come vpon you; your riches are corrupted, and your garments moth-eaten: your Gold and Siluer is cankered, and the ruſt thereof ſhall be a witneſſe againſt you, and ſhall eat your fleſh as it were Fire: you haue hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped vp treaſures to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:3139:223"/> for the laſt dayes.</q> Vnhappy Wealth, and euill! that doth no good to thoſe that haue it not; and doth hurt to thoſe that haue it: Troubling their Liues, blotting their Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, damning their Soules: and from a hell they made vnto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues: bringing them to the Hell prepared for them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Oh cry him mercy! he diſclaimes him that can claime any thing of him; that can ſay What,
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:3139:224"/> or Whom he hath Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, vndermined, polled, ingrated, ſpoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, cheated, circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented, or extorted. Whoſe Houſe hath he hired from ouer his head, or Field from vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his hands; or ſnatcht his meat from out his mouth, or pull'd his Raiment from off his backe: Hath hee beene a careleſſe execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour, an vnequall Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitratour, an vniuſt Guardian? Whoſe Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges hath hee with-held? Whoſe Eſtate hath he
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:3139:224"/> intangled? Whoſe Feof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment hath hee im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bezilled? Whoſe Pledge hath he not reſtored? What Promiſe hath he not performed? and what Debt hath he not diſcharged? Or who can ſay, this was his, or is, or ſo ought to be? He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies a World; what he hath, he came honeſtly by, and it is his owne. His Neighbour (for what he euer wrought, or thought againſt him) hath yet both Houſe, Wife, Child, Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, Oxe, Aſſe, and
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:3139:225"/> euery thing that is his. Excellent Phariſee! He hath kept the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements: But one thing is lacking; let him goe and ſell all that he hath, and giue vnto the Poore. He is iuſtifi'd (he thinkes) becauſe he hath done no man Wrong: Not knowing he is guilty, for that he hath done good to none. Others did he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer injure; and ſo he is free (he perſwades him) not conſidering he is bound to ſuccour o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. Call him Coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous;
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:3139:225"/> and he tells you, he neuer held others from their owne: But I tell him, he is Coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous; becauſe he holds his owne from others. <hi>Not only he that greedily inuades anothers, but he that niggardly detaines his owne, he alſo is Coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous. He hath ſlaine, that ſaues not; he hath hurt, that helpes not; he hath ſpoyled, that rewards not; he hath ſtarued, that che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes not; he hath ſtript, that cloaths not: and he that hath not giuen, euen he hath taken away. The
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:3139:226"/> Fault is no leſſe his, that beſtowes not on him that hath not; than his, that exacts from him that hath. The Corne which thou hoordeſt, is the Bread of the hungry; the Wooll and Flax which thou tranſporteſt, is the Cloth of the naked; the Gold and Siluer which thou doſt ſo heap and hide, is the Price of the Poore: He that wiſely gaue it thee for them; ſhall once (in their behalfe) as ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerely require it of thee, and thy like: <q rend="inline large">J was an

               </hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nay and you talke of Giuing, he is gone: This is (he ſayes) no World to Giue; him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe is (as others are)
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:3139:227"/> on the Taking hand. Quite of another mind from the <hi>Scripture;</hi> It is a more bleſſed thing (he ſayes) to Receiue, than to Giue: And (cleane contrary to the <hi>Prince,</hi> that thought that day loſt, in which he had giuen nothing) he thinkes it all loſt, in that day that he giues. You cannot beat Boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty into his Braines with a Beetle. A very Truant is he (and you examine him) at a leſſon of Libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality: and if you take in hand to tutour him;
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:3139:227"/> he makes any excuſe, takes any occaſion to buſie him otherwiſe, than about his Booke. You would not thinke how hee delayes the Dole to the Poore; and what Shifts he hath to ſhun a Beggar. If he but ſuſpect there ſits a needy Crauer neare to ſuch a Corner; he there either turnes another way, or lookes another way: He either mends his Pace, chats to his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion, or makes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe muſing on ſome haſty Matter: Now li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtens
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:3139:228"/> he to the other ſide, and the Poore-man is on his deafe eare. It is not the firſt, and a faint asking will auaile him any thing; hee muſt dogge him to it, for what he does. But if you once come ſo neare him, and follow him ſo fane, that hee muſt needes take notice though not of Your Want, yet of your Noyſe: he neuer ſtands <hi>Ieſuitically</hi> to equiuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate with you; <hi>I haue it not</hi> that is (he meanes) <hi>not for you:</hi> but tels you
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:3139:228"/> blunt out at once; <hi>I haue not for you.</hi> Aske him a Farthing, and he ſayes a Farthing is too little for him to giue; aske a Shilling, and hee replies, a Shilling is too much for you to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue: Aske more, or leſſe; he minds to ſerue you with a matter of nothing. Tell him you'l pray for him, if hee'l be pleaſed to giue; and he tells you, hee can haue Prayers better cheape: Say you'le pray for him, whether hee'le giue or no; and hee'le truſt you
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:3139:229"/> (he ſayes) for once. (A poore Cauill is it, to flout out anothers Neceſſitie.) And yet he thinkes, he hath thus put you off with as good a Grace, and as much Credit; as ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther could haue plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured you. But if hee be drawne to Giue, he giues ſo difficultly, ſo frowningly, with ſuch vpbraidings and reui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings; that he giues you a Fiſh, and a Serpent at once; and together with Bread, he puts a Stone into your Poke.
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:3139:229"/> You had better bee without his Gift; it is not ſo ſweet in the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, as bitter in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing. Salute him with a Suit; and hee ſtampes that he cannot ſtay to heare you: Hee now turnes, and talkes to euery one that comes by him: and cries, I come Sir, to any one that but opens the caſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment toward him. Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent him with your Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition, and he puts you to petition the ſecond time for an anſwer to the firſt: Heele put on
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:3139:230"/> his conſidering Cap, and bids you come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine for an anſwer: and ſo you muſt ſpend more Time, Labour, Coſt, for (perhaps) a further Delay; or (more likely) a flat Deniall. The Churle hates to be Poore; nor would he willingly be thought Rich: verify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Saying; <hi>He had rather be rich indeed, than ſo accounted.</hi> (Contrary to many wauering Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit-mongers, that ſeeke to be ſo accounted; ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing ſcarce wherewith
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:3139:230"/> to make vp their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts.) Eſpecially, how little doth hee ſet by himſelfe at a Leuie, Seſſment, Loane, Tax, or Subſidie? And all is becauſe hee would doe as little good as hee could, to King, Church, and Poore. He abhors to be charged with an Office of Charge: will Fine for a City Sheriffe; and will be ready to cut his owne throat, to be made Sheriffe of a Shire. He hates Papiſtrie for one Point eſpecially, becauſe they teach, A

The Hungry pine, while there is none to feed them; the Naked ſtarue, while there is none to cloath them; The Sicke languiſh, while there is none to viſit them; the Captiues call and cry,

            <p>Oh ho, now I haue him. Could you not thinke all this while, to what end he is ſo great a gatherer? You muſt not thinke What onely, but Whom he is to leaue behind him. Hee hath laid vp (with the <hi>Glutton</hi> in the <hi>Goſpell</hi>) <hi>

               </hi> It is a Fatherly affection that vrges him thus to ſcrape and heap: A Father (he thinkes) does not halfe loue his Children as he ought; that plots not by all meanes to make them rich. To beget Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and beſtow them, is (thinks he) a Fathers Whole: and to endow them largely is the only Education. <hi>Better not beget, than beget to Beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery;</hi>
               <pb n="430" facs="tcp:3139:234"/> is an Apothegme of his owne: but the old Rule he remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers not; <hi>Better vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne, than vntaught.</hi> No matter for Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, they ſhall haue Wealth enough. Goods are more than Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: What cares he whether they learne to liue well; his care is to leaue them well to liue. It is all one to be ſuch an ones Hogge, Horſe, Dogge; as his: Sonne: Nay, his Hogges ſhall haue a Swineheard, his Horſe a Rider, his
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:3139:234"/> Dogges a Futerer; but no Tutor for his Child. He will haue a Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard in his Field, a Bayly in his yard; but ſcarce a Miniſter in his pariſh: A Clarke for his Bonds, a Steward ouer his lands; but no Schoolemaſter to his Sonnes. He will looke that his land be well manured; but reſpects not though he that muſt haue it, be neuer ſo ill mannered.

            <p>And is it He, for whom thou doſt ſo toyle, and plod? Like thy Oxe and Aſſe then, thou art not for thy ſelfe. Thou art but the Conduit-Pipe, and he the Ceſterne: It comes thorow thine hands, but is laid vp for him. Thou therefore makeſt thee poore, to make him rich. And what good will it doe thee when thou art gone, that thou left'ſt a rich Heyre behind? Yea, more Rich (perhaps) than Good. Thou haſt gained for him, and ſo
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:3139:236"/> haſt loſt thine owne Soule. <hi>Did it <hi>DIVES</hi> any good, that his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren (after him) liued merrily; and (great-like) of his Goods?

What is it, that they beget iollity to them, and horrour to thy Selfe? Hereby haue they Pleaſure perhaps, but it but ſhort: but
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:3139:237"/> thou haſt torment both certaine, and endleſſe. <hi>A wealthy Sonne profiteth not a guilty Father: No, though he would giue all he left him, for Maſſes, Dirges, Pardons, and Prayers; it could not (what ere Men faine) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeme his Soule from Hell.</hi> Indeed, <hi>Happy</hi> (they ſay) <hi>is he, whoſe Father is in Hell.</hi> For (ſay they againe) <hi>A rich man is either a bad man, or a bad mans Heire.</hi> If himſelfe be bad, it will once goe worſe with him: but if he only be

Yet further; What faiſt thou, but another after thee may proue as la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſh, as thou haſt beene ſcraping; as riotous, as thou ſparing; and may ſcatter that in a Yeare, which tooke thee a Life to gather: and what pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit haſt thou, that thou haſt laboured for the Wind? Tis true, and iuſt; both ſaid, and Found: <hi>After a great Getter, there commonly

            <p>Nay but (I now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinke me) thou haſt neuer an Heire: For whom is it now thou doſt ſo toyle, and irke, yea and damne thy ſelfe? Thou knoweſt, thou muſt not haue them; and who muſt haue them, thou knoweſt not. Perhaps, one that neuer knew thee, or will neuer thanke thee. HE puts

One that loues thee well; and well he may, and it be but for the loue hee hath to thine. He can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not chuſe but loue thee horribly, while he loues Thine ſo impatiently: That is, he could wiſh Thee, and Thine at once, both hang'd, and had: yea, to haue Thine, what cares he to curſe Thee to Hell? He is one of the ſame Name (I am ſure)
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:3139:239"/> though not one of the Kinne. So, ſo; Keepe the Houſe howſoeuer in the ſame Name; belike the Line was not worthy of it.

If he haue no Monument of his Loynes; he can haue a Pillar of his Name: and thats enough to vphold his Houſe. <hi>This is one of the laſt, but not the leaſt follies of Men, to let a Title
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:3139:240"/> carry it, before the Right: To make Kinſmen Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, and a Kinſman of a Stranger: With the whole Price of an Heire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, to buy the Name of an Heire; or an Heire of the Name: To purchaſe a lying Affinity with a coſtly kinde of Adoption.</hi> Nay but the Heire that muſt be, is a Poore Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters Sonne: The poore rag'd Knaue (I can tell you) is like to be Lord of all. He ſhall one day owne all that is his Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles; though his Vncle now ſcarce will owne

You ſhall finde him ſet the firſt in his Will; which neuer was ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to ſit the laſt at his Table. <hi>It is the manner of the Couetous, to part with nothing while they liue; no not to thoſe, to whom they mind to leaue all at their Death.</hi> While he liues, all is too little for himſelfe; but let him take all to him, when he
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:3139:241"/> dies. His Heire is now beholden to him, not for what he hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed; but for what he could not keepe: And will therefore thanke him, when he ſhall not heare him; will pray for him when it ſhall doe him no good. Thou now lieſt gaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, and thine Heire is gaping: Euery looke he lets vpon thee, accuſes the ſlowneſſe of thy Death: For he thinkes it his Wrong and Hurt that thou liueſt. Hee ſighs and wailes before
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:3139:241"/> thee, not that he cares for thy loſſe; but hopes for thy Gaine: How he howles and blubbers, while thy hands quake, Teeth guaſh, Eyes cloſe, Breath ſtops, Heart choaks, and Soule flits; &amp; all, not ſo much that thou art now dead, as that thou diedſt not ere this. <hi>No Mans Death is more deſired, than the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetous Mans: It is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes expected, plotted often, yea and ſometimes vntimely effected. All therefore wiſh him dead; becauſe (like the Hog in

            </p>
            <p>Well, thou'lt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhake off theſe Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes; and mind'ſt (I heare) to build ſome Hoſpitall, Schoole, Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; or doe ſome cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable Deed withall.

Euery Creature is but vile to him, that knowes but his Creator. A whole Earth is too ſtrait for him, that lookes as wide as Heauen. The whole Ocean of the World is but as a drop to a thirſtie Soule; to whom one drop of the riuer of Paradiſe is plenteous re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhment. Hee counts Mammon but baſe, that

Not trouble ſome is it to him that beares it; but to him that will not beare it. Nothing is hard
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:3139:254"/> to a willing Mind: to an vnwilling is nothing eaſie. Pouerty is grieuous to no man; but rather many a Man is ſo to it. This is the miſery of it, that a man will needs make it ſo to himſelfe.</hi> I am worthily wretched, when I will not be otherwiſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, but that I am ſo.

Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath limited a Man to liue with little: And ſhall a Man thinke him Poore when he hath not wherewithall to tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſe Natures Bounds? There is a kinde of Meanneſſe, and Scant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to many a Man: It is their pecuiſhneſſe
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:3139:255"/> to call it Baſeneſſe, and Beggery: and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach it ſo, and abhor it. Men doe miſcall, what they know not how to eſteeme. And as Children are skarred at Bugge-beares, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled or fained Hob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goblins: ſo Fooles flie this Ghoſtly and gaſtly appearing Pouerty by Fire and Water, Sea and Land. Let others thinke Pouerty a wofull mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery; I will deeme it (as I well proue it) an happy Security. The Poore Man, he does no hurt;
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:3139:256"/> he feares no hurt: Hee is not enuied, not hated, not curſed; incures not the treacherous Enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Men: He ſings, and dances before the Theefe; ſleepes ſafe and ſound vnder euery Hedge. Nothing hath he, he feares to loſe; and lies ſo low, as whence he cannot fall. I ſhould therefore like Pouerty the better, becauſe it is leſſe obnoxious to Feare, and Loſſe; <hi>Who would ſtill trouble him to poſſeſſe Riches; that muſt once be more troubled in
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:3139:256"/> their Loſſe? It is ſafer a great deale, not to Haue, than to Loſe: And hee farre merrier, whom For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune neuer reſpected; than whom ſhe hath now forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.</hi> The Leſſer I am; I am Greater, than whom Change, or Chance may indam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage.</p>
            <p>But ſay Pouerty were worſe than it is; and I poorer than I am: I am ot other than Others, yea and my Betters haue likewiſe beene. What ſhould I tell of poore Kings, Prophets, Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles,
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:3139:257"/> Fathers, Saints? CHRIST <hi>himſelfe was Poore:</hi> borne of a poore Woman, brought forth in a poore Stable, lapt in poore Clouts, laid in a poore Manger, liued a poore Life: HE, euen he hungred, he wanted; he had not wherewith to pay the Due; he had not whereon to lay his Head. <hi>Now Worme of Earth, how is it thou coueteſt ſo to be rich; ſith the God of Heauen and Earth, was ſo willing to be Poore. What was there in the World, was worthy

Why would hee want theſe Things of ours? but to tell vs, that we our ſelues might well bee without them: Why contemne them? but to teach vs not to deſire them.</hi> My SAVIOVR cared not to bee rich, feared not to bee Poore: to bid me not trouble my ſelfe with ſo need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe Feares, and Cares.</p>
